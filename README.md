This repository contains the necessary code to conduct analysis and reproduce the figures in the work XXX. Strided trajectories are provided here to reduce file size, see below for full trajectories to reproduce the full analyses. 

Input files to perform the simulations, along with output data (including trajectories) that we generated in our work are freely available at: XXX
